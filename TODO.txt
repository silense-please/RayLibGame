//DONE
// mb array[10] to count average fps
// test button inputs and gamepad - working
// make fps independent game loop (with sf::Clock i guess)

TODO - make test game

character control and objects render
divide code to different cpp files
try different "scenes" or/and side-scrolling
make RPG and collisions
maybe make rez options (with buttons only for now)
try OpenGL integration
try online sockets
maybe build custom fps lock with sleep(sf::asMicroseconds) (or with chrono and thread)
FPS Monitor (sometimes?) crashes SFML window upon closing FPS Monitor
switch fps/frametime outputs with buttons
output ingame timer to ensure it works properly

RayLib:
fix ToggleFullscreen by implementing code from SetWindowMonitor(which is sets fullscreen too in fact)

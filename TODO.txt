DONE
mb array[10] to count average fps
test button inputs and gamepad - working
make fps independent game loop (with sf::Clock i guess)
divide code to different cpp files
window resizing - use render target texture - DONE
screen scaling
recreate everything from sfml template
character control (inputs) - add input method choosing (gamepad 1, gamepad 2, keyboard?) and current detected gamepads
divide code to funtions and structs(like: Playerstruct, draw_debugging_metrics, draw, toggle_fps_lock, ...)
level editor (in txt for now)
movement collision

IN PROGRESS
 gravity (and jumps?)
make good jumps

check out raylib template platformer

TODO - make test game (engine demo)
pause system (and UI)
camera - side-scrolling
sound system
animation
make RPG-7

Big input refactor - key presses in input section result actions, which are then processed in game logic
    (какая то структура данных(enum?) со всеми actions)
Define and write down to txt all game(window) inputs
refactor after "engine v1" done - sweep comments, restructure, fill declaration.cpp, make "debug" and release game mode e.t.c
compile release build and test it on VM and then on dimkanet's PC

Texture loading and unloading system and characters' ids system to link them with texture
different game "scenes" - levels basically

define tile resolution (64 pixels) and refactor all "tile usages" - done???
error handling and output - try/catch
write tests (unittests i guess)
saves - game state (serialization?)
unhardcode player inputs
timestamps - UPS - game logic has to update at fixed rate (60 per sec)

try level editors - LDtk, Tiled
try OpenGL integration
try online sockets
try Box2D physics
maybe make rez options (with buttons only for now)
refctor - maybe write corresponding declaration in it's modules - draw, load, e.t.c (to reduce coupling)


Problems:
    Window crashes when audio output device is changed
    fix ToggleFullscreen by implementing code from SetWindowMonitor(which is sets fullscreen too in fact)
    Performance slowdown - might be a bottleneck(probably fine) - when on primary 1440p display in borderless mode
        - fps is dropping form ~2500 to ~1700, frametime from ~0,3-4ms to ~0,5ms, in motherloving ToggleFullscreen() it's rising up to 3000fps!
        Found the cause - nvidia shadowplay! (it's switching to game window in borderless)- slowing ~33% performance (on high framerates) (only primary monitor)
    Initial resolution and aspect ratio is hardcoded - might need resize_texture2d
    Txt level dimensions are hardcoded
    Cursor is disappearing in borderless with discord or OBS - Well... what can I do?
    FPS Monitor (sometimes?) crashes SFML window upon closing FPS Monitor

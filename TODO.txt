//DONE
// mb array[10] to count average fps
// test button inputs and gamepad - working
// make fps independent game loop (with sf::Clock i guess)

TODO - make test game

divide code to different cpp files
character control and objects render
screen scaling and camera
maybe make rez options (with buttons only for now)
try different "scenes" or/and side-scrolling
make RPG-7 and collisions
try OpenGL integration
try online sockets
maybe build custom fps lock with sleep(sf::asMicroseconds) (or with chrono and thread)
FPS Monitor (sometimes?) crashes SFML window upon closing FPS Monitor
switch fps/frametime outputs with buttons
output ingame timer to ensure it works properly

RayLib:
fix ToggleFullscreen by implementing code from SetWindowMonitor(which is sets fullscreen too in fact)

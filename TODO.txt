DONE
mb array[10] to count average fps
test button inputs and gamepad - working
make fps independent game loop (with sf::Clock i guess)
divide code to different cpp files
window resizing - use render target texture - DONE

TODO - make test game

character control and objects render
screen scaling and camera
maybe make rez options (with buttons only for now)
try different "scenes" or/and side-scrolling
make RPG-7 and collisions
try OpenGL integration
try online sockets
maybe build custom fps lock with sleep(sf::asMicroseconds) (or with chrono and thread)
FPS Monitor (sometimes?) crashes SFML window upon closing FPS Monitor
switch fps/frametime outputs with buttons
output ingame timer to ensure it works properly

Problems:
    fix ToggleFullscreen by implementing code from SetWindowMonitor(which is sets fullscreen too in fact)
    Performance slowdown - might be a bottleneck(probably fine) :
                target render texture - fps dropped form ~2500 to ~2000
                borderless mode - fps dropped form ~2000 to ~1700 , frametime from ~0,3-4ms to ~0,5ms
    initial resolution and aspect ratio is hardcoded - might need resize_texture2d
    cursor is disappearing in borderless

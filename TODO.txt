DONE
mb array[10] to count average fps
test button inputs and gamepad - working
make fps independent game loop (with sf::Clock i guess)

TODO - make test game

divide code to different cpp files
character control and objects render
screen scaling and camera
maybe make rez options (with buttons only for now)
try different "scenes" or/and side-scrolling
make RPG-7 and collisions
try OpenGL integration
try online sockets
maybe build custom fps lock with sleep(sf::asMicroseconds) (or with chrono and thread)
FPS Monitor (sometimes?) crashes SFML window upon closing FPS Monitor
switch fps/frametime outputs with buttons
output ingame timer to ensure it works properly

Problems:
    fix ToggleFullscreen by implementing code from SetWindowMonitor(which is sets fullscreen too in fact)
    window resizing - use render target texture
    Performance slowdown - might be a bottleneck(probably fine) :
                target render texture - fps dropped form ~2500 to ~2000
                borderless mode - fps dropped form ~2000 to ~1700 , frametime from ~0,3-4ms to ~0,5ms
